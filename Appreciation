I just wanted to take a sec, as an Asheville native, technophilic atheist, and social justice citizen,
to thank you all for what you are doing and to ask you if there is any way
in which someone like me, with negligible coding skills, could get involved or help out.

I apologize for having to reach out this way as it's the only venue for contact I am aware of currently for yall.

I hope to hear back and would love if yall shot me an email or DM.

Email is calebthehumanist@gmail.com
Or you can find me on Twitter or Discord under simp1ejackk 

Thanks so much for your time!!
